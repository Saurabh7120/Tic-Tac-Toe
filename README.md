# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of tic-tac-toe made using python

Steps to run the game:

1.Install python3
  Run "python3 --version" command in your terminal to see if python3 is installed on your system or not.
  If not, download python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
2.After having python3 installed on your system, go to the folder where you have the code by running the command, "cd /*FOLDER_PATH*/"

3.Once you are into the folder, run "python3 main.py" to start the game.

4.The game would start with asking player 1 to enter the column first (1-3) and then the row (1-3)
  Once player 1 enters the column and row he wants his "X" to be in, the board will appear with player 1's "X" entered at the position specified by player 1.
  
5.Now it's time for player 2 to enter the column first (1-3) and then the row (1-3)
  Once player 2 enters the column and row he wants his "O" to be in, the board will appear with player 1's "O" entered at the position specified by player 2.
  
6.Continuing the process, the player to form a chain of 3 "X"/"O" vertically/horizontally/Diagonally wins!
